This WIP will serve as a reminder application when the user has not pushed anything to their github profile that day. If a user has not made any public commits by their set time of the day, it will send them a basic SMS message reminding them to write some code and push it up. It uses the SMTP Python library to accomplish this.

It is written in Python 3.
